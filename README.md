# theoryinterface<br>
(v. 0.0)<br>
 A Max patch that displays notes entered by MIDI on a keyboard and a staff, with integrated video or screen capture.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
❧ The interface assumes an accidental is a sharp, unless you select a number of flats in the bottom left. You can also choose to have C or F read as B# or E#.<br>
❧ If your MIDI keyboard is not producing anything, look in Options->MIDI Setup.<br>
❧ Choose whether the center of the window displays your camera, a screenshare, or neither with the buttons at the bottom left.<br>
❧ You can adjust the width of the screenshare. If you have camera problems, they might be fixable in the 'camera options' at the bottom left of the camera/screenshare.<br>
❧ The camera creates a lag, which is exacerbated with Zoom. I put in a delay so you might be able to make it sync up. (Mute your main microphone in Zoom and only share computer sound.)<br>
❧ To make computer sound work, you will need to raise the volume; failing that, look in Options->Audio Status, and try to select the ZoomAudioDevice.<br>

(v. 0.0)<br>
A Max patch that displays notes entered by MIDI on a keyboard and a staff, with integrated video or screen capture.<br>
<br>
Choose whether the center of the window displays your camera, a screenshare, or neither with the buttons at the bottom left.<br>
You can adjust the width of the screenshare. If you have camera problems, they might be fixable in the 'camera options' at the bottom left of the camera/screenshare.<br>
The camera creates a lag, which is exacerbated with Zoom. I put in a delay so you might be able to make it sync up. (Mute your main microphone in Zoom and only share computer sound.)<br>
To make computer sound work, you will need to raise the volume; failing that, look in Options->Audio Status, and try to selected the ZoomAudioDevice.<br>
